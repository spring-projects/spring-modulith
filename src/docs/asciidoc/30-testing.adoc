= Integration Testing Application Modules

Spring Modulith allows to run integration tests bootstrapping individual application modules in isolation or combination with others.
To achieve this, place JUnit test class in an application module package or any sub-package of that and annotate it with `@ApplicationModuleTest`:

.A application module integration test class
[source, java]
----
package example.order;

@ApplicationModuleTest
class OrderIntegrationTests {

  // Individual test cases go here
}
----

This will run your integration test similar to what `@SpringBootTest` would have achieved but with the bootstrap actually limited to the application module the test resides in.
If you configure the log level for `org.springframework.modulith` to `DEBUG`, you will see detailed information about how the test execution customizes the Spring Boot bootstrap:

Note, how the output contains the detailed information about the module included in the test run.
It creates the application module module, finds the module to be run and limits the application of auto-configuration, component and entity scanning to the corresponding packages.

[[testing.bootstrap-modes]]
== Bootstrap Modes

The application module test can be bootstrapped in a variety of modes:

* `STANDALONE` (default) -- Runs the current module only.
* `DIRECT_DEPENDENCIES` -- Runs the current module as well as all modules the current one directly depends on.
* `ALL_DEPENDENCIES` -- Runs the current module and the entire tree of modules depended on.

[[testing.efferent-dependencies]]
== Dealing with Efferent Dependencies

When an application module is bootstrapped, the Spring beans it contains will be instantiated.
If those contain bean references that cross module boundaries, the bootstrap will fail if those other modules are not included in the test run (see <<testing.bootstrap-modes>> for details).
While a natural reaction might be to expand the scope of the application modules included, it is usually a better option to mock the target beans.

.Mocking Spring bean dependencies in other application modules
[source, java]
----
@ApplicationModuleTest
class InventoryIntegrationTests {

  @MockBean SomeOtherComponent someOtherComponent;
}
----

Spring Boot will create bean definitions and instances for the types defined as `@MockBean` and add them to the `ApplicationContext` bootstrapped for the test run.

If you find your application module depending on too many beans of other ones, that is usually a sign of high coupling between them.
The dependencies should be reviewed for whether they are candidates for replacement by publishing a domain event (see <<events>>).
