= Observing Application Modules
:imagesdir: images

The interaction between application modules can be intercepted to create Micrometer spans to ultimately end up in traces you can visualize in tools like https://zipkin.io/[Zipkin].
To activate the instrumentation add the following runtime dependency to your project:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.modulith</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-modulith-observability</artifactId>
  <version>{projectVersion}</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

This will cause all Spring components that are part of the application module's API being decorated with an aspect that will intercept invocations and create Micrometer spans for them.
A sample invocation trace can be seen below:

In this particular case, triggering the payment changes the state of the order which then causes an order completion event being triggered.
This gets picked up asynchronously by the engine that triggers another state change on the order, works for a couple of seconds and triggers the final state change on the order in turn.
